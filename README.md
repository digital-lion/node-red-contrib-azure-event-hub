# node-red-contrib-dl-azure-event-hub
This node can be used to send messages from node-RED to the Azure EventHub. It was forked since the original node from clovity showed instabilities (node-red restarts after several days depending on the memory of your device).

It is based on https://github.com/clovityinc/node-red-contrib-azure-event-hub-send-message therefore the documentation was extracted and modified from there.

## Input Parameters

### Name (Optional)
Rename your node

### Connection String (Mandatory):
Get the connection string from your eventHub instance after setting up the security rules.
Endpoint=sb://????????.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKey=????????;EntityPath=????????

### Event Hub path (Mandatory):
Adress path of the eventHub to which the messages should be addressed.
